<h1>GFramework - <i>Simple, Dynamic & Powerful (PHP5.3+)</i></h1>
We offer you not just a framework, also a suggestion. 
I hear you saying "What do you mean suggestion?". 
What I meant is you will see a dynamic coding style that allows you to create simple and quick but powerful websites. 
This framework will automate every code you normally use on a website.
<br />
<h2>Main features we offer</h2>
<ul>
	<li>URL connection management; Link every url request to a dynamic web-page.</li>
	<li>Language wrapper; Use language wrapper to create multi-language supported web-pages</li>
	<li>Include PAR (PHP Archive); You don't need to do anything when you need to include extarnal sources just put them to your library folder. (This PAR files are not the same with Official PAR files)</li>
	<li>
		Resource wrapper; Your pattern includes images? 
		You want them to be linked to your website URL? 
		Then just write a simple code to link them.
	</li>
</ul>
<br />
You can add anything else to your system. 
And don't forget to block accesses to your library and source folder.
Beacuse it's not necessary.
Just allow your data folder and others you want.
